## Description

We built a website called "VolunteerUp". This website lets you plan or join
projects to improve your community, whether it's cleaning up a dirty walking
path, landscaping a park, fixing potholes, it's up to you!

This website allows you to register, create a profile, login/logout, join or
leave projects, create projects, comment on them, and if you have permission,
edit or delete projects, comments, and volunteers. We also have an admin role
that allows you special permissions to edit projects or volunteers on the site.
The website also allows you to track the hours volunteers have pledged and
contributed to the project, and also tools and skills needed by the project and
provided by volunteers.

## How to use

From the home page you have a couple of options to interact with the website. You have the choice to search the existing projects in the database by keyword. Type the keyword you would like to search by in the search field under "Search by Keyword(s)" and press the green search button directly under the field. Your list of results will populate below the large picture  with each project's vital information listed. To learn more about a project, press the green "View Project" below the project description.
If this is your first time visiting VolunteerUp you will want to register and create an account. In the top right hand corner press the "Login/Register" icon to proceed to the respective page. At the Login/Register page you have a choice on the right to "Create Account". In future visits, after you create an account, you will return to this page to sign in with your username and password. Click the "Create Account" button. Enter your email address, username, and password in their respective fields and continue to enter further information to set up your account on the following page. Press Submit and your profile is created. You are now capable of creating projects, joining projects, and leaving comments you're apart of.



## Requirements

Our website was created to satisfy the following requirements of our midterm
project:

- A fully developed database schema. The database must be connected to your Java code using JPA.
- Our friend C.R.U.D, this time manipulating objects and saving them in an appropriate database table.
- A user log in, which is authenticated by a mySQL table. There should be different permission levels for the users, one admin that can add/update/delete content present on the site.
- A correct implementation of a session object, this can be used to track a logged in user and any changes they make (for example, a shopping cart or favorites list).
- A way to track an individual user's previous experiences on the site. For example if it is a food ordering system, a list of previous orders.

## Technology Used

SpringMVC with SpringBoot, MySQL, CRUD, HTML, CSS, JSP, Bootstrap, AWS.
